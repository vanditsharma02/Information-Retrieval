# Information-Retrieval
The Solution for Information Retrieval Assignments (CS60092) Autumn 2020 at IIT Kharagpur. This repository is organized as follows-

- A1 - Implement Boolean Retrieval System to answer wild card queries using the schemes discussed in the class. 
- A2 - Implement Ranked Retrieval System to answer free text queries using the schemes discussed in the class. 
- A3 - Implement a Text Classification System using Naive Bayes, Rocchio, and KNN Algorithms. 

Also analyze the impact of different optimization techniques such as feature selection, champion lists, cluster pruning, etc. on the performance of implemented systems.
