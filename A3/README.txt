1) Please use output file name without the extension such as 'output_file_1' instead of 'output_file_1.txt'
(Following this notation since the code name your-code.py explicitly included the .py extension, but that is not mentioned here, so not sure whether to include it or not)

2) For dataset path, please use something like '/ABC/XYZ/.../dataset' instead of '/ABC/XYZ/.../dataset/'

So, the final input syntax will be something like => python3 17EC10060_1.py ./dataset output_file_1
